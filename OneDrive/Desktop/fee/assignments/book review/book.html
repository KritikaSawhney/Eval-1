    <h2>My Review</h2>
    <p>This Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is a timeless classic that has captivated readers for generations. Through the eyes of a young girl named Scout, Harper Lee masterfully weaves a story of racial injustice, tolerance, and the loss of innocence in a small Alabama town during the 1930s.</p>
    <p>The characters are richly drawn and relatable, with Atticus Finch being one of the most iconic and morally upright characters in literature. The writing is beautiful, evocative, and engaging, making it easy to become fully immersed in the story.</p>
    <p>I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story, is interested in American history, or simply wants to experience a masterpiece of literature.</p>

          <h2>My Review</h2>
          <p>In a land without magic, where the king rules with an iron hand, an assassin is summoned to the castle. She comes not to kill the king, but to win her freedom. If she defeats twenty-three killers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she is released from prison to serve as the king's champion. Her name is Celaena Sardothien.

            The Crown Prince will provoke her. The Captain of the Guard will protect her. But something evil dwells in the castle of glassâ€”and it's there to kill. When her competitors start dying one by one, Celaena's fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival, and a desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her world.</p>
