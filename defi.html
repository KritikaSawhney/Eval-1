                    <p>Short for decentralized finance, DeFi is an umbrella term for peer-to-peer financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum.</p>

                <h2>Why is DeFi important?</h2>
                <p>DeFi takes the basic premise of Bitcoin — digital money — and expands on it, creating an entire digital alternative to Wall Street...</p>
                <h2>What are the benefits?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open: You don’t need to apply for anything or "open" an account. You just get access by creating a wallet.</li>
                    <li>Pseudonymous: You don’t need to provide your name, email address, or any personal information.</li>
                    <li>Flexible: You can move your assets anywhere at any time, without asking for permission, waiting for long transfers to finish, and paying expensive fees.</li>
                    <li>Fast: Interest Rates and rewards often update rapidly...</li>
                    <li>Transparent: Everyone involved can see the full set of transactions...</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                <p>Users typically engage with DeFi via software called dapps (“decentralized apps”), most of which currently run on the Ethereum blockchain...</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lending: Lend out your crypto and earn interest and rewards every minute...</li>
                    <li>Getting a loan: Obtain a loan instantly without filling in paperwork...</li>
                    <li>Trading: Make peer-to-peer trades of certain crypto assets...</li>
                    <li>Saving for the future: Put some of your crypto into savings account alternatives...</li>
                    <li>Buying derivatives: Make long or short bets on certain assets...</li>

<p class="card-text">DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is a broad category of applications and services built on blockchain networks, primarily Ethereum, that aim to recreate and enhance traditional financial systems in a decentralized manner. "Decentralized Apps" or dApps are applications that run on a blockchain, providing various DeFi services. "DeFi Tokens" are the native assets used within these DeFi applications, often representing governance, staking, or liquidity provider rewards.</p>
